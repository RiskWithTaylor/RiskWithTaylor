## 🎯 About Me

I'm a Information Technology undergraduate who’s pivoting toward a data-centered, forward-looking future in **Actuarial Science and Academia**.  
Driven by a passion for solving complex problems where **Climate & Catastrophe Modeling, Financial Risk, and Health Insurance**, I’m building a strong foundation in **R programming, statistics, and risk modeling** — one project at a time.

> 📌 Currently preparing for Western Governors University’s **M.S in Data Science (Winter 2025) and M.S in Actuarial Science (Spring 2027)**.
