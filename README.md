## 🎯 About Me

I'm a Information Technology undergraduate who’s pivoting toward a data-centered, forward-looking future in **Actuarial Science and Academia**.  
Driven by a passion for solving complex problems where **Catastrophe Modeling, Financial Risk, and Health Insurance meet**, I’m building a strong foundation in **R programming, statistics, and risk modeling** — one project at a time.

> 📌 Currently preparing for Western Governors University’s **M.S in Data Science (Winter 2025) and M.S in Actuarial Science (Spring 2027)**.

## 🚀 Career Vision

📌 I aim to become a risk expert working at the intersection of:  
**→ Insurance | Cybersecurity | Public Policy | FinTech**  

Long-term? I want to use quantitative insights to influence decision-making in **underrepresented, high-risk systems** — especially within **Healthcare access and Technology**.

Moreover, I want to bridge my Information Technology backround + academia research by becoming a **future educator** at a university later in my career
