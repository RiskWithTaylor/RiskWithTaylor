## 🚀 Career Vision

📌 I aim to become a risk expert working at the intersection of:  
**→ Insurance | Public Policy | FinTech**  

Long-term? I want to use quantitative insights to influence decision-making in **underrepresented, high-risk systems** — especially within **Healthcare Access and Technology**.

Moreover, I want to bridge my Information Technology backround + academia research by becoming a **future educator** at a university later in my career
