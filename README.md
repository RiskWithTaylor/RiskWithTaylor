## 🎯 About Me

I'm a Finance undergraduate who’s pivoting toward a data-centered, forward-looking future in **Actuarial Science and Quantitative Risk Analysis**.  
Driven by a passion for solving complex problems where **finance, public policy, and data meet**, I’m building a strong foundation in **R programming, statistics, and risk modeling** — one project at a time.

> 📌 Currently preparing for Georgia State University’s **M.S. in Actuarial Science and Quantitative Risk Analysis (Spring 2027 cohort)**.
